# Serious game experiment

## Demo

https://guillaumeliard.github.io/learn-x/

## Goal

The goal of the game is to catch the most keys without loosing all three lives.
To move the chariot, the user has to push either the minus sign or the plus sign.
Pushing the plus sign moves the chariot to the right of the x axis.
Pushing the minus sign moves the chariot to the left of the x axis.

## Meta goal

The meta goal of the game is to enable the gamer/learner to intuitively associate right/left directions (dimension A) with plus/minus operations (dimension B).

The mapping of dimensions A and B in this game (a.k.a. "plus is to the right") mirrors conventions commonly used in math and computer science when one wants to move an element along a horizontal line.

n.b: the position of those two signs is shuffled every n seconds to disambiguate their position with their meaning
