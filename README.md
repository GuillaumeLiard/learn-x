# Serious game experiment

## Demo

https://guillaumeliard.github.io/learn-x/

## Goal

The goal of the game is to catch the most keys without loosing all three lives.
To move the chariot, the user has to push either the minus sign or the plus sign.
Pushing the plus sign moves the chariot to the right.
Pushing the minus sign moves the chariot to the left.

## Meta goal

The meta goal of the game is to enable the gamer/learner to intuitively associate :
- the right direction with the addition operation
- the left direction with the substraction operation

Those are conventions which are commonly found in math or computer science when one wants to move an element along a line in a given direction (x axis in this case)

n.b: the position of those two signs is shuffled every n seconds to disambiguate their position with there meaning
